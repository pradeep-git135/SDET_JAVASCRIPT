node js : nodeJs is a wraper written on top of plane_javascript to perform server side programming

webdriverJs : default selenium binding is webdriverJS

webdriverIo : it is a wrapper written on top of webdriverJS by using nodejs

javascript : 
  1) javascript is a scripting language (interpretation and execution occurs at run time)
  2) javascript is useed to develop an interactive webpages (dynamic web pages)
  3) javascript is mainly used for client side validation
  4) dynamically typed language (int a = 10;  var a = 10, var a = "pradeep")
  5) js is a case sensitive 
  

 browser can understand javascript bcz inbuilt has a translater 
 each and every indivisual browser has a specific translater 
for e.g chrome browser has an interpreter called v8
	mozillaFirefoox has spiderMonkey
	safari has javascript_core
	ie has chakra

javascript can be executed on 2 platforms:
 1) on the browser ==> any browser
	we can embed our javascript code in html
		2 different ways 
			1] inline embeding i.e, by using script tag (<script> </script>)  
			2] external embeding i.e, by using script tag with src attribute (<script src = "file path"> </script>)
2) off the browser ==> server side and we need nodeJs for it
	we will make use of node to execute our javascript code i.e, node <file name>


tokens: tokens are the smallest unit of javascript code 
	tokens are classified into:
		1] keywords : 
			keywords are programmer defined words i.e, already they have a prdefined meaning (e.g var, if, else, for, foreach, let, const)	       
		2] identifiers:
			user defined words or named memory blocks (e.g var x = 10, y = "string")
			it may be combination of alfanumeric but it shouldn't start with numeric i.e, a2 = 20,==> valid   2a = 20 ==> invalid 
			_ and $ we can use 
		3] literals:
			literals are the values that we store inside the memory
		4] operators: 
			symbol used to perform mathematical operations (=, ==, <, >, /, +)
		5] separetors:
			are the symbols used to separate the code (e.g (,), {, }, ; [,])

datatypes in javascript:
2 types 
 1) premitive 
 2) non premitive 
premetive datatypes:
	1] number datatype
	2] string
	3] boolean
	4] null
	5] undefined 
non premitive 
1] objects 
2] functions
